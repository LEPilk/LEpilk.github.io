### Case Study
[Google Data Analytics Capstone: BikeShare](https://github.com/LEPilk/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/google-data-analytics-capstone-bikeshare.ipynb)

As part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone course, I had to prepare a case study that applied the data cleaning, exploration, and analysis skills learned in the course. 

For this project I used R as it could do all of the mentioned work as well as data visualizations.
