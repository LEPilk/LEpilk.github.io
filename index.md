As part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone course, I had to prepare a case study that applied the data cleaning, exploration, and analysis skills taught in the course. 

For this project I used R as it could do all of the mentioned work as well as data visualizations. 

### Machine Learning & Data Science Survey Analysis and Visualization

I entered Kaggle's annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey competition, both to practice my analysis and for some real world application. 

Since completing my Google Data Analytics certification I've been working on small projects and using my new skills for my work as an online content manager (with a focus on personal finance).

I'd love to learn more, but I've quickly discovered there's so much to the data analytics/science field. I'm reviewing the 2021 Survey to get a clearer idea of where to focus my attention this upcoming year.
